# Migration Strategies

The six R's:

- Rehosting
- Replatforming
- Refactoring/re-architecting
- Repurchasing
- Retaining
- Retiring

**Replatforming**

Replatforming, also known as “lift, tinker, and shift,” involves making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit. Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application.

**Refactoring/re-architecting**

Refactoring (also known as re-architecting) involves reimagining how an application is architected and developed by using cloud-native features. Refactoring is driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or performance that would otherwise be difficult to achieve in the application’s existing environment.

**Repurchasing**

Repurchasing involves moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service model.

For example, a business might choose to implement the repurchasing strategy by migrating from a customer relationship management (CRM) system to Salesforce.com.

**Retaining**

Retaining consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment. This might include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated, or, work that can be postponed until a later time.

**Retiring**

Retiring is the process of removing applications that are no longer needed.
