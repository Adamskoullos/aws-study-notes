# Free Tier

The free tier has three categories:

1. Always free
2. 12 months free
3. Trials

# Pricing Concepts

1. Pay for what you use
2. Pay less when you reserve: **Commit to 1 or 3 year contract for a specific usage and get a lower $/hour price**
3. Volume based discounts

# AWS Lambda

Lambda is charged for the number of invocations and the time it takes to run the functions.

Part of the `Always Free` tier, Lambda gets `1 million` free requests per month and `3.2 million seconds` compute time per month.

# EC2

> Free tier for 12 months: 750 hrs active use of t3.micro instances

# S3

> Free tier for 12 months: 5gb storage, 20,000 GET, 2,000 PUT/POST and 15gb data transfer per month
